In the summary output, the Pr(>ltl) value for each of the coefficients represents that probability of a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to the results, ground clearance and mpg provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The p-value of the linear regression regression model is 6.712e-11, which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05% meaning that the slope of the linear model is not zero. In addition, the r-squared value of the linear regression model is 0.6791, meaning that roughly 68% of all predictions will be correct when using this model thus making it an effective predictor of mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
