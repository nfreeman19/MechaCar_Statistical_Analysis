## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In the summary output, the Pr(>ltl) value for each of the coefficients represents that probability of a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to the results, ground clearance and mpg provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The p-value of the linear regression regression model is 6.712e-11, which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05% meaning that the slope of the linear model is not zero. In addition, the r-squared value of the linear regression model is 0.6791, meaning that roughly 68% of all predictions will be correct when using this model thus making it an effective predictor of mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### Total Summary:

### Lot Summary:
![myTest]()

In the total summary, we found the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI column. In the lot summary, we also found the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI column, but it is separated by manufacturing lot. In total, the entire population of the production lot has a variance of 62.29 PSI, which is within the 100 PSI limit. However, when looking at each manufacturing lot individually, only Lot 1 (variance of 0.98 PSI) and Lot 2 (variance of 7.47 PSI) are within the 100 PSI limit as Lot 3 has a variance of 170.29 PSI.
